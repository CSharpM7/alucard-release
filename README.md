# Alucard Release Page

This is the official release page for the Alucard mod. Head over to the releases page to download!

## Prerequisit Plugins 

Alongside Arcorpolis, you will need the following plugins:
- [nro_hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/nro-hook-plugin/releases)
- [smashline_hook](https://github.com/blu-dev/smashline_hook/releases)


## Installation

Unzip the contents of the latest release, and drag directly to the root of your SD card! If done properly, you should see 3 Alucard-related folders inside `ultimate/mods/`. This will also add a few other folders that are used to keep track of the current version of Alucard. Whenever a new release is published here, you should receive a notification about a new Alucard update the next time you boot smash with Alucard enabled.

When booting Smash for the first time with these mods, make sure you chose NOT to enable all new mods! Moveset and Moveset X will cause crashes if both are enabled.
